the.","startTime":"05:09","endTime":"05:15","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It will be like.","startTime":"05:15","endTime":"05:16","speaker_name":"123

diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Correct.","startTime":"05:20","endTime":"05:20","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it's everything

diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's something that you can add and add.","startTime":"05:22","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You just start by one package.","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:27","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it has everything, correct.","startTime":"05:27","endTime":"05:28","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I mean, it really.","startTime":"05:29","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There are some specifics I feel like we needed to get to as far as things that might be down the road.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:36","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Essentially.","startTime":"05:37","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What you're saying, you know, the initial package, that's pretty much just whatever you need for the initial build.","startTime":"05:38","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, we get a lot of it set up already, but in this kind of situation where it's something kind of totally new and you're just trying to clean it up.","startTime":"05:44","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hey, Miguel.","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How's it going?","startTime":"05:52","endTime":"05:53","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Hey, Chase.","startTime":"05:53","endTime":"05:54","speaker_name":"Miguel E.

Figueroa","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, absolutely.","startTime":"05:59","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Great to see you as well.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I was wondering if I was going to get to see Miguel anywhere.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This process.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Gay.","startTime":"06:07","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"Miguel E. Figueroa","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Nice, nice.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"Miguel E. Figueroa","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"All right, go ahead.","startTime":"06:13","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"Miguel E. Figueroa","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, no, yeah, it's all good.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All good.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So essentially, the main package that really is.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's pretty much everything that you would need for us building out the store, really.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:26","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Anything in between, anything that we can do to automate any fulfillment, any communication that goes on in between, you know, we'll get a lot of it set up just based off what we know right now.","startTime":"06:26","endTime":"06:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But this kind of scenario, it's basically like the first four weeks, we're pretty much just doing an audit.","startTime":"06:38","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, any information you can give us, you want us to go through, like, hey, there's, this part of our system or lack of, however it is, and we kind of run through that, see how you guys are doing it, you know, how we could automate it and tackle that just kind of by what's most important, what would help you guys the most as far as something that you're having to do manually, things like that.","startTime":"06:43","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So typically that would pretty much be that whole first month.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, there's some things in between that, you know, might become more of a priority and things like that just as we go through things.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we're looking at, you know, a month or so to just kind of get initially whatever it is that you guys need kind of step one.","startTime":"07:17","endTime":"07:24","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But also, you know, this kind of process, you know, has a couple more steps and you know, just a lot more caution.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:31","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Obviously when you guys are operating right now, this is not something that's just off.","startTime":"07:31","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So kind of doing it in phases as, you know, we get things in a really good place.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:41","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, we're going to roll this out, make sure that it's rerouting to this part, you know, kind of just in sections.","startTime":"07:41","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We're not going to try to just.","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, we have the whole thing, just turn off the other one.","startTime":"07:48","endTime":"07:50","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, that's not.","startTime":"07:50","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not the best way to go about things.","startTime":"07:51","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So just kind of doing it through phases as whatever is the most important to you guys.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And one thing I did want to ask too is kind of how what you guys thought about the locations, because this is kind of assuming we would probably start with this is from what I know again, there's probably some details you guys could tell me as far as how things operate, as far as the whole locations and things like that.","startTime":"07:59","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But essentially I would think if we want to, we could just basically have an account for each location.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:23","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I can share my screen and kind of show you.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:26","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Chase, can you show again, Miguel, the demo that you showed me about the emails and everything.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Remember the one that you showed me and to Gabi.","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, sure, sorry.","startTime":"08:42","endTime":"08:45","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think I was sharing the right window here.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:47","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There we go.","startTime":"08:47","endTime":"08:48","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right, so just for perspective, what I was talking about.","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So essentially like this is my view, but I go up here, you see we have Diesel Group Global.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"08:58","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Essentially we could build this one out totally with all the tools, automations in between and everything.","startTime":"08:58","endTime":"09:04","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And once that's in a really good place, assuming it's similar operations, we could essentially make this one Diesel Group Miami, we could make another one for each location.","startTime":"09:04","endTime":"09:15","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And basically from that first one, when we build out that whole system we can just paste it into the other ones, you know, put in the right people for those locations and things like that and keep them separate.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:27","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or if there's ones there really should all be the same.","startTime":"09:27","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We could do it that way too.","startTime":"09:31","endTime":"09:32","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I just kind of wanted to throw that out there.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I know we didn't really get into too many details on that, but that could pretty much, that could be something kind of like step two saying we just kind of first step, do the main location or however you guys system is set up like that and just kind of do it over time like that.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:49","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, yeah, but for example, if, I mean I.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"09:55","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We gotta start with, I mean just say Miami.","startTime":"09:55","endTime":"09:57","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"09:58","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So basically we'll put there what Miami's email like to do the follow ups.","startTime":"09:58","endTime":"10:07","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Remember the automatic follow ups and everything that for example, if someone send an email or if someone calls, we can just send, okay, call this number and transfer to these other numbers.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Remember?","startTime":"10:16","endTime":"10:16","speaker_name":"123 diesel","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"10:16","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"100%.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:18","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"100%, yeah.","startTime":"10:18","endTime":"10:19","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So Miguel, basically this is the whole app platform.","startTime":"10:19","endTime":"10:23","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm not sure if Carlos showed you, but the same thing is on a mobile app.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:27","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we could also make the mobile app, you know, like you guys's branded app if you

them, you know, saying okay, you know, make sure you follow up with xyz.","startTime":"32:31","endTime":"32:44","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's part of what we'll do in these automations.","startTime":"32:45","endTime":"32:47","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So as much as we have what we're talking about with following up with someone, things like that, we'll just have that kind of automatically, dynamically for whoever.","startTime":"32:47","endTime":"32:58","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we

situation, it's something that we're kind of building out custom so it's a little more drawn out.","startTime":"34:19","endTime":"34:26","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But you know, essentially we would have an initial onboarding call just kind of going through.","startTime":"34:26","endTime":"34:31","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All right,

first.","startTime":"34:38","endTime":"34:47","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like getting in here and getting your calendar and your emails tied in here, we could do that, you know, first couple days.","startTime":"34:47","endTime":"34:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that would definitely be like step one is, you know, whether

days.","startTime":"36:48","endTime":"36:54","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, you're looking at probably like the first two weeks, just kind of making sure we get the phone numbers approved, we'll get the AI agent everything tuned in ready to where we at least have it.","startTime":"36:55","endTime":"37:07","speaker_name":"Chase
