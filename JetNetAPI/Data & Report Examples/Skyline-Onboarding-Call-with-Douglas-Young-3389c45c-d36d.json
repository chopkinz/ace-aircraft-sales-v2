are.","startTime":"19:23","endTime":"19:27","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I wouldn't even say clients because I use it a lot for like prospecting emails and all that stuff.","startTime":"19:27","endTime":"19:31","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like when you get in there, you'll see like I have imported names and there's a tag to each name.","startTime":"19:32","endTime":"19:38","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's like Arizona Aircraft Owners Group.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:42","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it's like citation M2 owners group.","startTime":"19:42","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because what I would do then is I'd filter those down and I'd send a mass email to all of

you.","startTime":"20:07","endTime":"20:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I always like.","startTime":"20:09","endTime":"20:10","speaker_name":"Douglas

those.","startTime":"20:31","endTime":"20:33","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then tasks, this is where you could assign tasks to contacts or yourself, you know, so think of it kind of as like a trello, anything like that.","startTime":"20:33","endTime":"20:42","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you go to add a task, you know, task title, description, xyz.","startTime":"20:42","endTime":"20:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But then you can tie it to a customer and then assign it to you.","startTime":"20:51","endTime":"20:54","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it could be like, you know, call Casey on Thursday at 8am, assign it to

created.","startTime":"21:06","endTime":"21:11","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so those are tasks.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:15","speaker_name":"Douglas

something.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:24","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It autos assigns a task to you to follow up with them, something like that.","startTime":"21:24","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we can automate a lot of that as

companies.","startTime":"21:42","endTime":"21:43","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, just some examples we put in there.","startTime":"21:49","endTime":"21:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's companies, like I said, the smart list.","startTime":"21:52","endTime":"21:54","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's kind of how we can group those contacts and things like that.","startTime":"21:54","endTime":"21:58","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Get those built out for you so you can navigate it a little better.","startTime":"21:58","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that is contacts, clients.","startTime":"22:03","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then if you go to opportunities, this is probably where you'll live the most.","startTime":"22:06","endTime":"22:10","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is just going to be your pipeline.","startTime":"22:10","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, pipelines.","startTime":"22:14","endTime":"22:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's not any in there right now but you know, essentially there'll be different cards and we can have all the details matched in there.","startTime":"22:19","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It'll be associated with the contact or the customer and you know, we can auto move them through.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:34","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You'll be able to manually move them through here as well.","startTime":"22:34","endTime":"22:36","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But most likely pipeline will be where you live the most.","startTime":"22:36","endTime":"22:40","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, now here's the one thing like I get in some businesses like the CRM, it's important to have like the value to each one, like the opportunities.","startTime":"22:40","endTime":"22:49","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"22:49","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Give the value.","startTime":"22:50","endTime":"22:50","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I don't really care about that because the value like is, I mean unless I know what I'm making commission wise on a deal.","startTime":"22:52","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But like is there a way, can we just get rid of that or is that like a standard feature?","startTime":"22:59","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's pretty standard but like whether we populate or use it's really not a big deal.","startTime":"23:04","endTime":"23:08","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I kind of agree.","startTime":"23:08","endTime":"23:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean in a lot of situations it's, I mean it's not really set in stone and a lot of widgets here.","startTime":"23:09","endTime":"23:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it's like, you know.","startTime":"23:16","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So and we don't have to worry about that.","startTime":"23:19","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We might not use it too much.","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:23","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that'll be the pipelines payments.","startTime":"23:25","endTime":"23:29","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't think we'll probably be using that.","startTime":"23:29","endTime":"23:31","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean we didn't really talk about it but I assume.","startTime":"23:31","endTime":"23:33","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't even know how you guys do these deals but I imagine there's an aspect of it you'll just be popping it in manually at some point.","startTime":"23:33","endTime":"23:43","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So there's that.","startTime":"23:45","endTime":"23:46","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I will say I think it would be super beneficial if you go up to the top, you see documents and contracts.","startTime":"23:47","endTime":"23:54","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you have like any standard like contracts, documents that you normally send over via DocuSign, things like that, essentially you don't need DocuSign or Panda Docs, any of that anymore.","startTime":"23:58","endTime":"24:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is what that is.","startTime":"24:09","endTime":"24:10","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We can send those through here and we can even automatically send them, things like that.","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:14","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you have.","startTime":"24:14","endTime":"24:15","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Before I send them, what's that?","startTime":"24:16","endTime":"24:18","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can I edit them before I send them?","startTime":"24:18","endTime":"24:20","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So like, if I send over a listing agreement, I need to put in airplane.","startTime":"24:20","endTime":"24:23","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah.","startTime":"24:23","endTime":"24:23","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So there's ones that, you know, we might could send out automatically, but if nothing else, you can just have like your standard templates right here and then yeah, you can definitely, you can just go in, make some tweaks and send it out.","startTime":"24:23","endTime":"24:33","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But it is good because you can still see just like DocuSign or anything like that.","startTime":"24:33","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Once you send it, you see if it's sent, you see if they viewed it and then obviously you get notifications when it was signed, things like that.","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:45","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"24:46","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that would probably be another thing just along with the other stuff on the media storage.","startTime":"24:49","endTime":"24:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you have those, if you could just like upload an example or two, I'll go ahead and get the template started here for you.","startTime":"24:55","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Get those spun up.","startTime":"25:01","endTime":"25:02","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Agreements.","startTime":"25:06","endTime":"25:07","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right, so that is that you see AI agents.","startTime":"25:11","endTime":"25:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If and when we ever wanted to make like a voice agent or something that could chat with, that's where this would be.","startTime":"25:16","endTime":"25:22","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't think you have to worry about it too much right now, but if you get bored, want to mess around with it is pretty cool.","startTime":"25:23","endTime":"25:28","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"25:29","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we go on to marketing.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"25:32","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can connect Facebook, Instagram, your Google business profile, really everything here.","startTime":"25:37","endTime":"25:43","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we can.","startTime":"25:43","endTime":"25:44","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You could bulk schedule and post things on your socials.","startTime":"25:44","endTime":"25:49","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Pretty cool.","startTime":"25:50","endTime":"25:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Go to emails.","startTime":"25:51","endTime":"25:52","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is basically the email builder.","startTime":"25:52","endTime":"25:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We can send out email blasts, campaigns, things like that.","startTime":"25:55","endTime":"25:58","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think maybe the main thing would just be if you go up and you see the templates, if you have any past emails or things like that, even if you just want to upload them in there and then I can spin up everything from there.","startTime":"26:00","endTime":"26:12","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But basically you have your templates and then they'll be tied to a campaign and then once they send out, you can see all the statistics and everything.","startTime":"26:12","endTime":"26:20","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"26:21","endTime":"26:22","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We go to automation.","startTime":"26:23","endTime":"26:25","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This will just be where all the workflows are.","startTime":"26:25","endTime":"26:27","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where's that at?","startTime":"26:28","endTime":"26:29","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, left side.","startTime":"26:29","endTime":"26:30","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just be good to know.","startTime":"26:32","endTime":"26:33","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I doubt you'll be doing much with the workflows and everything, but just to kind of know where everything's at.","startTime":"26:33","endTime":"26:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I didn't really use those on a pipe drive.","startTime":"26:39","endTime":"26:41","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I thought I would, but that'd be more of why I'm here.","startTime":"26:41","endTime":"26:44","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll be messing with it, but at least so you know where they're at.","startTime":"26:44","endTime":"26:47","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We go to sites.","startTime":"26:48","endTime":"26:49","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a ton of different stuff that we can do here.","startTime":"26:49","endTime":"26:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we could build out a funnel, different website stores.","startTime":"26:53","endTime":"26:57","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm thinking that maybe we could even once we get the scraper and everything up and running, we could make basically like a funnel for.","startTime":"26:57","endTime":"27:06","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Even if we just say it's like a market research tool, things like that.","startTime":"27:06","endTime":"27:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But if you want to run some ads, we can just target it to a specific funnel, things like that.","startTime":"27:09","endTime":"27:15","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But super easy to spin up and launch different sites, stores, things like that.","startTime":"27:15","endTime":"27:21","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So when you say sites, what exactly you mean just.","startTime":"27:21","endTime":"27:25","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I know you already have a website, but like we can make another website.","startTime":"27:25","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Typically what people do is like, we're gonna onboard here, get it built out, and then when it's ready to rip, they want to run an ad.","startTime":"27:28","endTime":"27:37","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then we run different ads to different funnels.","startTime":"27:37","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we might make a funnel that's like, I don't know, easy PJ Sales or something like, you know what I mean?","startTime":"27:40","endTime":"27:50","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or something like that.","startTime":"27:50","endTime":"27:51","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we could have niche funnels.","startTime":"27:51","endTime":"27:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So we could have a funnel for people in Scottsdale, funnel for people in a different area or different kinds of aircraft, things like that.","startTime":"27:55","endTime":"28:02","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We could have funnel different variations, split, test them, things like that.","startTime":"28:02","endTime":"28:05","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"28:05","endTime":"28:06","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's.","startTime":"28:08","endTime":"28:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That everything's kind of straightforward.","startTime":"28:09","endTime":"28:11","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Webinars, analytics.","startTime":"28:11","endTime":"28:12","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you go to client portal, basically we can set up like Ace Aircraft client portal.","startTime":"28:12","endTime":"28:21","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if anything else, you could set up like a referral program in there and they could have commissions showing in there and everything.","startTime":"28:21","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But one of the main things being like, if you send out contracts for deals or invoices, all of the things like that through the platform, they can log in and see all of that on there and manage them and everything.","startTime":"28:30","endTime":"28:42","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"28:43","endTime":"28:44","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As well as if you had, I don't know if you have any kind of content of like, I don't know, almost like courses or things you wanted to walk them through, upsell them on.","startTime":"28:44","endTime":"28:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I don't know, we could put that in there, but if nothing else, we could just make it built out to where they can go see their contracts and things like that.","startTime":"28:55","endTime":"29:02","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's kind of.","startTime":"29:02","endTime":"29:02","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, up to you.","startTime":"29:02","endTime":"29:03","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it'll be along the lines of that like going in and be able to look at the market research report or something like that.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:10","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, for sure.","startTime":"29:11","endTime":"29:12","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Memberships, that would just be if there was any kind of subscription were doing or you had courses you were selling.","startTime":"29:13","endTime":"29:19","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I don't think that will be too relevant to us.","startTime":"29:19","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Media storage.","startTime":"29:24","endTime":"29:25","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's basically your Google Drive reputation.","startTime":"29:25","endTime":"29:28","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So basically, I think another big thing, I looked at it and looks like you do already have a Google business profile.","startTime":"29:29","endTime":"29:35","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you go to integrations later and get that connected, we could basically like after somebody buys a plane, whatnot, we can automatically, you know, send them a text message, email whatnot, asking for a review.","startTime":"29:37","endTime":"29:49","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And this keeps track of your reputation management.","startTime":"29:50","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, if it's gotten better, gotten worse, how many receive, how many reviews you receive, things like that.","startTime":"29:53","endTime":"29:59","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, all right.","startTime":"30:03","endTime":"30:05","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then if we go to reporting, these are just all the different reports.","startTime":"30:05","endTime":"30:09","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's a lot of standard reports that we can schedule out.","startTime":"30:09","endTime":"30:13","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can make them go out to you know, once a day, once a week, whatnot.","startTime":"30:13","endTime":"30:17","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"If you were running ads and wanted to see like how much you were spending, how much per lead XYZ or how many appointments you had, as well as I think most likely we'll build out the market researcher and I can do a custom report here and have it go out to you, whatever cadence you want.","startTime":"30:17","endTime":"30:36","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But a lot that we can do there.","startTime":"30:36","endTime":"30:39","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's just kind of like the reporting portal app marketplace.","startTime":"30:39","endTime":"30:45","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's just where we can go find different plugins and things like that.","startTime":"30:46","endTime":"30:50","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is where I was saying, once we get the market researcher out, we can put it up on here for sale and anybody in the world could go on here and buy it, install it.","startTime":"30:50","endTime":"31:00","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's just where you can basically go buy different plugins.","startTime":"31:00","endTime":"31:04","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's pretty cool mobile app that'll just give you the links to download the mobile app, if you haven't already.","startTime":"31:05","endTime":"31:12","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"No, I haven't.","startTime":"31:13","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'll go in there and do that.","startTime":"31:13","endTime":"31:14","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cool, cool.","startTime":"31:16","endTime":"31:17","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I mean like some of this stuff too.","startTime":"31:21","endTime":"31:22","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Obviously you'll learn how kind of I do business.","startTime":"31:22","endTime":"31:26","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You're gonna be like, oh yeah, you don't need this then this is a robot, this and that, you know, so.","startTime":"31:26","endTime":"31:31","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right, yeah, this is just base level.","startTime":"31:31","endTime":"31:33","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The first time ever.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:34","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just making sure that you've seen it before.","startTime":"31:34","endTime":"31:37","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, most likely a lot of this.","startTime":"31:37","endTime":"31:38","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're only gonna use a couple of these items.","startTime":"31:38","endTime":"31:41","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, exactly, that's that.","startTime":"31:41","endTime":"31:44","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then essentially if there's any other platforms, anything that you use in your day to day, I can add it here at the bottom.","startTime":"31:44","endTime":"31:52","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like if you click on Jetnet, let me know if that's the right URL.","startTime":"31:52","endTime":"31:55","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But even for that, you can not have to leave, you know, your platform or anything and just have it right there.","startTime":"31:55","endTime":"32:04","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's it.","startTime":"32:06","endTime":"32:07","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So do you, how do you need my login for that?","startTime":"32:07","endTime":"32:10","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"No, it's just.","startTime":"32:12","endTime":"32:13","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just put a URL and tie it right there.","startTime":"32:13","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So all I could find was just the Jetnet login.","startTime":"32:16","endTime":"32:19","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"32:21","endTime":"32:21","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then you can do all your Jetnet stuff right there and you can just pop back and forth to opportunities, whatever.","startTime":"32:21","endTime":"32:27","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like I said too, if there's any other platforms that you usually are going back and forth on, we can add it on there.","startTime":"32:27","endTime":"32:34","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you can literally have everything in one place.","startTime":"32:34","endTime":"32:36","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"32:37","endTime":"32:37","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I think that's about it for just kind of the basic layout and everything.","startTime":"32:41","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But we got your emails connected, so that's good.","startTime":"32:47","endTime":"32:50","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"They can start flowing in through there.","startTime":"32:50","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll get your calendar set up so you can start getting appointments and things like that.","startTime":"32:53","endTime":"32:58","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Where's your website hosted at?","startTime":"33:01","endTime":"33:03","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You said squarespace here.","startTime":"33:03","endTime":"33:05","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm on it right now.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:05","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me see here.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:06","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Actually, I'm gonna share this.","startTime":"33:09","endTime":"33:10","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So permissions, probably what you need.","startTime":"33:13","endTime":"33:15","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes.","startTime":"33:16","endTime":"33:16","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Invite contributor for basic author.","startTime":"33:24","endTime":"33:28","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's probably contributor.","startTime":"33:29","endTime":"33:30","speaker_name":"Chase Hopkins","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is everything you'll be able to get.","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:36","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You need like DNS and all that, right?","startTime":"34:03","endTime":"34:04","speaker_name":"Douglas Young","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess maybe just do administrator and then let me get in there and
