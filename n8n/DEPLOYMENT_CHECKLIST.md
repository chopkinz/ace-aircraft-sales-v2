# N8N JetNet Sync Workflow - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Setup

- [ ] N8N instance is running and accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are configured:
  - [ ] `JETNET_USERNAME` - JetNet API username
  - [ ] `JETNET_PASSWORD` - JetNet API password
  - [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application base URL
- [ ] Webhook endpoint is accessible: `{NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/jetnet/webhook-callback`
- [ ] Database connection is working
- [ ] JetNet API credentials are valid and tested

### ✅ Workflow Validation

- [ ] Run test script: `node scripts/test-n8n-workflow.js`
- [ ] All tests pass (JSON valid, nodes present, connections valid)
- [ ] Workflow flow reaches end nodes successfully
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Error handling is implemented

### ✅ Security Review

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in workflow
- [ ] Environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Webhook endpoint has proper authentication
- [ ] API rate limits are respected
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive data

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Import Workflow

- [ ] Copy `n8n/sync.json` to N8N instance
- [ ] Import workflow in N8N interface
- [ ] Verify all nodes are properly configured
- [ ] Check node connections are intact

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# In N8N environment settings
JETNET_USERNAME=chase@theskylinebusinessgroup.com
JETNET_PASSWORD=Smiley654!
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://ace-aircraft-sales-v2.vercel.app
```

### 3. Test Configuration

- [ ] Test JetNet authentication manually
- [ ] Verify webhook endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Check database connectivity
- [ ] Validate API rate limits

### 4. Initial Test Run

- [ ] Run workflow with small batch (5-10 aircraft)
- [ ] Monitor execution logs
- [ ] Verify data is processed correctly
- [ ] Check webhook delivery
- [ ] Review error handling

### 5. Production Deployment

- [ ] Run full workflow test
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Document deployment details

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### ✅ Immediate Checks (First 24 hours)

- [ ] Workflow executes without errors
- [ ] Data is synced to database correctly
- [ ] Webhook deliveries are successful
- [ ] Performance is within expected ranges
- [ ] No authentication failures

### ✅ Ongoing Monitoring

- [ ] Daily execution logs review
- [ ] Weekly performance analysis
- [ ] Monthly error rate assessment
- [ ] Quarterly security review
- [ ] Annual credential rotation
